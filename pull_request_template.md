### Before submitting

Please complete the following checklist when submitting a PR:

- [ ] All new features must include a unit test.
      If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add a test to the
      test directory!

- [ ] All new functions and code must be clearly commented and documented.
      If you do make documentation changes, make sure that the docs build and
      render correctly by running `make docs`.

- [ ] Ensure that the test suite passes.
      

- [ ] The Photon_Weave source code conforms to
      [PEP8 standards](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
      
When all the above are checked, delete everything above the dashed
line and fill in the pull request template.
